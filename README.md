Customer Segmentation for Selore UK - Electronics Retail Chain
This project involves developing a customer segmentation model for Selore UK, a popular electronics retail chain specializing in the sale of mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and related accessories. Founded in 2022, Selore UK has become one of the largest retailers of electronics in the UK, offering top-brand products from Samsung, Apple, Nokia, and Huawei, alongside after-sales support, trade-in options, and repair services. With its numerous outlets nationwide, Selore UK is a go-to destination for customers seeking quality electronics and services.

Business Objective
The primary objective of this project is to help Selore UK understand the spending behavior and demographics of its customers to develop personalized marketing campaigns, optimize pricing, and improve product recommendations. By leveraging customer segmentation, the company can strategically target different customer groups with tailored solutions and enhance overall customer satisfaction.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information on 200 customers, including:

CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer.
Gender: The gender of the customer.
Age: Customer's age.
Annual Income: Annual income of the customer (in $k).
Spending Score: A score (0â€“100) based on customer spending behavior.
Problem Statement
Using the collected customer data, the goal is to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior and demographic attributes. This will be achieved using unsupervised learning techniques such as clustering, which will help identify distinct groups of customers with similar characteristics and spending habits.

Proposed Solution
The segmentation model will provide actionable insights into customer behaviors, enabling Selore UK to:

Develop targeted marketing campaigns to increase engagement and sales.
Personalize product recommendations to match customer preferences.
Optimize pricing strategies for different customer segments.
Identify high-value customers and design loyalty programs.
Technologies and Tools
Python for data analysis and modeling.
Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation.
Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
Scikit-learn for clustering algorithms such as k-means.
Outcome
The customer segmentation model will classify customers into distinct groups, allowing Selore UK to better understand their audience, improve business efficiency, and achieve data-driven decision-making.

This project demonstrates the power of unsupervised learning in retail and highlights the importance of data-driven marketing strategies in achieving competitive advantages.
